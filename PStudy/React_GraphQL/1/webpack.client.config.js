/**
 * 
HtmlWebpackPlug: This automatically generates an HTML file that includes all of the webpack bundles. We pass our previously created index.html as a template.
CleanWebpackPlugin: This empties all of the provided directories to clean old build files. The cleanOnceBeforeBuildPatterns property specifies an array of folders which are cleaned before the build process is started.
The entry field tells webpack where the starting point of our application is. This file needs to be created by us.
The output object specifies how our bundle is called and where it should be saved. For us, this is dist/client/bundle.js.
Inside module.rules, we match our file extensions with the correct loaders. All JavaScript files (except those located in node_modules) are transpiled by Babel, specified by babel-loader , so that we can use ES6 features inside our code. Our CSS gets processed by style-loader and css-loader. There are many more loaders for JavaScript, CSS, and other file extensions available.
The devServer feature of webpack enables us to run the React code directly. It includes hot reloading code in the browser without rerunning a build or refreshing the browser tab.
